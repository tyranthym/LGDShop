asp.net core 2.2

1. ef core

when using .AsNoTracking() together with .Include(emp => emp.Department) which emp.Department can be null, emp.Department is not populated correctly.
Any place used emp.Department afterward will throw exception


walkaround: check DepartmentId == null first, if it's null just set the target directly to null instead using emp.Department?.Name
